          %h2 Developers Mailing List
          %p
            This is a mailing list geared towards developing PicketLink itself.  It often contains deep, technical discussions on how PicketLink works internally, how new features could be implemented, and is definitely not the place for end user questions such as how to configure, use or even troubleshoot PicketLink.  Please use the User Forums for such questions.
          %p
            If, however, you are helping contribute to PicketLink, we welcome your thoughts, ideas and overall participation on the developers' mailing list.
